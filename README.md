# CodingHavoc

This is the code for the main page of my portfolio website that can be found here: [CodingHavoc](http://www.codinghavoc.com). I built the page using Python and Django with Bootstrap for the styling. Most of the site is static but I do have a blog (of sorts) that pulls information from a database on the backend. There are a few other small applications that I'm working out a few things before publishing live.

## Other applications

### GNDN

Goes Nowhere Does Nothing (a reference to Star Trek: The Original Series) is a simple sign-up and login application. There is no special information hidden behind logging in, after you do you're simply taken to a page that says you're logged in and has a log out button (goes nowhere, does nothing).
