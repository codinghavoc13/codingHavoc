                <p>This is one of my bigger, more elaborate projects that started years ago when I started a course on
                    MongoDB. Driving home from work, I was thinking about it and asked myself how hard it would be to
                    write a basic NoSQL database type system from scratch.</p>
                <p>The basic idea behind it is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information would be stored in Nodes, each Node having a key/value pair</li>
                    <li>Nodes would be stored on Pages</li>
                    <li>Pages would be stored in Folders</li>
                    <li>Folders would either be stored in other Folders or in Drawers</li>
                    <li>Drawers (you guessed it) would be stored in File Cabinets, hence the name of the project</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The data is stored between sessions using XML files.</p>
                <p>Initially developed using Java, I've made some small steps in replicating in C++ C# and Python. The
                    main Java version uses Swing to build out a User Interface, and the C# has a similar User Interface
                    using WPF.</p>

            </button>

            <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>This was actually a final project for one of the course I took. The base assignment was, given a
                    skelaton project, complete the program to allow two users to place their five ships on a board, then
                    play a game of classic Battleship. The program would handle checking for hits or misses. A simple
                    text display showed the board and the results.</p>
                <p>I quickly finished up the base requirement for the assignment and started work on adding to the
                    program, turns out this extra work ended up being an opportunity for bonus points: add to the
                    program and allow a user to play against the program.</p>
                <p><i>"Wouldn't you prefer a good game of chess?" -WOPR</i></p>
                <p>By the time this extra credit was announced, I was half way complete. I mirrored the program's
                    hunting plan on my own, to go with a 'check board' approach, calling every other block and not
                    calling an adjacent block unless I was checking for a hit.In other words: A1, A3, B2, C1, C3 but not
                    the others unless I got a hit in one of those block, and obviously not in that exact order.</p>
                <p>Testing that the AI was balanced was a simple case of replicating the end scene from Wargames and
                    having the AI play 100 games against itself and keeping track of the results, checking that the
                    balance was close to 50/50. I don't remember the numbers but it was close enough for me to call it a
                    success.</p>
                <p>Initially written in Java, I've done some work to replicate it C++, C# and Python</p>

                                <p>When I was first learning programming languages, one of the early projects was
                                    usually a simple
                                    Caesar Cipher. For those who haven't heard of it, a Caesar Cipher is a simple, crude
                                    encryption
                                    method. I would use it as a way of working with arrays, strings and substrings,
                                    loops, input and
                                    output. Now I am using it as a tool for developing Django, Spring, and ASP.Net based
                                    applications.
                                    As each application comes online, those will become links to them.</p>

                                    can show off,
                                    I'm working on a Spring Boot web application that could be used to manage
                                    information at a school.
                                </p>
                                <p>At this point, my plans for what to track include, but are not limited to:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Student information</li>
                                    <li>Parent and Emergency Contact information</li>
                                    <li>Grades for classwork, homework, quizzes, tests, etc</li>
                                    <li>Absences and tardiness</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Teachers would enter absences and grades. Office administrators would update
                                    tardiness and contact
                                    information. Students and parents would be able to view grades, absences and
                                    tardiness. Keeping
                                    track of which teachers the students had, and which grades were submitted by which
                                    teacher in each
                                    grade. Parents would be able to enter and update their contact information and
                                    emergency contact
                                    information. I'm debating adding a very basic messaging system.</p>
